# Collector
## Project Description
> Buy, sell, and trade to complete your ultimate collection or just show off your coolest collectables in this web marketplace. 

## The MVP
> Users have a customizable profile page showing off their collection(s), forums to discuss buying, selling, trading, or just general information, and the ability to also conduct said transactions, all on the same website.

## Milestones
Milestones include:
- Ability for users to have their own customizable pages for showcasing their collections
- The ability to make transactions with other users
- Forum/Community for users to discuss

## Stretch Goals
Some stretch goals, but feel free to make your own: 
- Automatic Pricing
- Extensive user profile customiztion
- Provide for a wide range of different collections to be available on the website

## Tech Stack
> the tech stack is does not need to be concrete; feel free to do your own research and decide what technologies would be best suited for the app! I can always provide resources and my personal input on anything you might want to add.

##### Here are some ideas:
* [React] - component based frame work, prevents boilerplating!
* [MySQL] - Use the trial version for running the database portion of this project. Uses queries to pull information
* [Firebase] - Firebase might be good for this project, it easily integrates with React and might be able to be used for a variety of the features this web app hopes to accomplish.
* [Django] - Although a little older, I do know its a solid web framework in python that can also be used with SQL pretty easily (its already setup to work with SQLite)
* [VisualStudioCode] - Good IDE for web development
* [git] - Terminal for pushing code to github (Here is a [cheat sheet])

I will add more documentation as needed, such as how to download the tech stack that we decide on or other pertinent information. Feel free to also edit this readme to serve as the overview for your project.
